# Project: Giftastic

## Overview
The giftastic application uses Giphy API's to pull requested images, allowing the user to view and save some gifs as favorite. User creates "buttons" which allows them to search through the buttons respective keyword, as well as specifying the amount of gifs to show from 1-10. Gifs appear to users as a still image, but can be clicked on to play. A button is generated below each gif which gives users the option to save it as a "favorite" which saves to their local storage.
